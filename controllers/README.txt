The three controllers in this directory are meant to load in pre-trained agents
to use a controller in the "OtherControllers" Directory to train or load other agents, 
simply drag the controller folder into this directory.

Also, in the filepath that loads the agent in the controller for each subproblem will need to be changed to the actor-critic agent in the BEST_AGENT folder in the controller directory.

i.e. yourPath/controllers/SP#_Controller/BEST_AGENT/agent
